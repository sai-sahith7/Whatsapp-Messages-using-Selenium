# Whatsapp-Messages-using-Selenium

Send custom message to multiple recipients ( requires their mobile number ) in bulk using Selenium 

You must need a list of mobile numbers in a .txt file

It is fine even if any recipient does not have a whatsapp account. In the end, you would be provided with a list of numbers ( if any ) which are not associated with Whatsapp so that the user would know which recipents did not recive their message.
